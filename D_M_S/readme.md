Discrete Mathematical Structures Topic Description:
The course objectives for Discrete Mathematical Structures include:
• Learning the mathematical foundations required for computer science.
• Helping in understanding other courses in computer science.
Upon completion of this course, students are expected to be able to:
• Learn propositional logic and set theory.
• Learn the concept of functions and recurrence relations.
• Learn counting techniques and relations.
• Learn concepts of graphs and their applications.
The course content is structured into four units:
• Unit-I: Logic and Proofs: Covers propositional logic, propositional equivalences, predicates and quantifiers, nested quantifiers, rules of inference, and an introduction to proofs. It also includes sets, Venn Diagrams, subsets, the size of a set, power sets, Cartesian products, and set operations.
• Unit-II: Functions: Explores one-to-one and onto functions, inverse functions, compositions of functions, and partial functions. This unit also delves into sequences, recurrence relations, and summations.
• Unit-III: Counting and Relations: Discusses the basics of counting, the Pigeonhole Principle, permutations and combinations, binomial coefficients and identities. For relations, it covers their properties, n-ary relations and their applications, representing relations, closure of relations, equivalence relations, and partial orderings.
• Unit-IV: Graph Theory: Introduces graph terminology and special types of graphs, bipartite graphs, representing graphs, isomorphism of graphs, Euler and Hamilton paths. It also covers shortest path problems (including Dijkstra’s Algorithm), the Traveling Salesperson Problem, planar graphs, graph coloring, tree traversal, and minimum spanning trees.
Lab Work:
The provided sources do not explicitly mention any dedicated lab work or assignments for the "Discrete Mathematical Structures" paper. While the general note states that students have to do laboratory assignments mentioned under different subjects/papers and encourages additional assignments, there is no specific "Lab:" section listed under Paper V, unlike other papers such as "Introduction to Computer Science and Python Programming" (Paper I), "Problem Solving with C Programming" (Paper II), "Data Structures" (Paper III), and "Data Base Management System" (Paper IV).
