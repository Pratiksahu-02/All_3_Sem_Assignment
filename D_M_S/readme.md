# Discrete Mathematical Structures (DMS)

## Course Overview
This course provides a solid foundation in the mathematical principles that underpin computer science. It emphasizes logical reasoning, analytical thinking, and problem-solving through various mathematical constructs.

## Course Objectives
- Build an understanding of propositional logic and set theory.
- Explore the concept of functions, including one-to-one, onto, and inverse functions.
- Master counting techniques along with recurrence relations.
- Delve into the fundamentals of graph theory and its practical applications.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Formulate and prove logical statements using various methods.
- Employ set theory to solve problems related to collections and relations.
- Analyze and design functions and relations in mathematical contexts.
- Apply graph theory concepts to solve real-world problems such as network traversal and optimization.
